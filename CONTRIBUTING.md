## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Before creating a new issue:

1. **Check if the issue has already been reported** by searching under [Issues](https://github.com/dialogchain/python/issues).
2. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/dialogchain/python/issues/new/choose).

A good bug report includes:

- A clear, descriptive title
- A description of the expected behavior
- A description of the actual behavior
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any relevant error messages or logs
- Your environment (OS, Python version, etc.)
